  "advance_recommend": true or false,
  "advance_reason": "one sentence explaining the recommendation",
  "rubric_scores": [

      "question": "short question title matching the rubric heading, e.g. Q1: API Layer",
      "score": <integer 0-4, where 0 = not reached/no evidence, 1 = far below expectations, 2 = partial understanding, 3 = meets expectations (equivalent to old "pass"), 4 = exceeds expectations with exceptional depth/clarity>,

For rubric_scores: score every question in the rubric on the 0-4 scale, mapping the rubric's Pass/Partial/Fail criteria onto it (Pass ≈ 3-4, Partial ≈ 2, Fail ≈ 0-1). Base the score strictly on evidence from the conversation — what the candidate actually said, not what they should have said. If a rubric question was never reached, score it 0 with reason "not reached in session".
For intent_map: include every meaningful candidate turn and key agent turns. Skip pure filler. Labels must be concise past-tense phrases like "explained the filter logic" or "got stuck on edge case". Do not copy these examples directly."""
